# Collapse Everything Else Extensions

A simple Visual Studio extension that allows you to collapse all outlining sections in the current document except for the currently highligted one.

## Usage

Adds a new menu item:
`Edit > Outlining > Collapse Everything Else`

By default, the command is bound to the shortcut key `Ctrl+M,S` (e.g. Collapse '**s**ome').

## Installation

Install this extension using the .vsix from [the latest release](../../releases/latest).

## Implementation

For more details on the implementation of the extension, see [the writeup I did of the process](https://github.com/veleek/til/blob/master/vs/execute_commands_from_a_vs_extension.md).
